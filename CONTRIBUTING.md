## Development Setup

To build and test OSTP locally, you will need:

*   **Rust** (current stable): install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
*   **Git**.
*   Only for the desktop GUI: **Node.js 18+** and the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).
*   Only for the Android app: **Flutter** and the Android NDK.

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ospab/ostp.git
    cd ostp
    ```

2.  **Build the entire Cargo workspace**:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
    The web panel (`ostp-server/panel/`) is plain HTML/CSS/JS embedded into
    the server binary: there is no separate build step.

3.  **Run tests**:
    ```bash
    cargo test --workspace
    ```

## Project Structure

The repository is a Cargo workspace plus two app projects:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`ostp/`](ostp) | The `ostp` binary: CLI, setup wizard, `cert`/`sub`/`panel`/`dns` commands, runs client or server from the config. |
| [`ostp-core/`](ostp-core) | The protocol: Noise handshake, header obfuscation, framing and padding, ARQ, congestion control, relay messages, share links. |
| [`ostp-client/`](ostp-client) | Client: local SOCKS5/HTTP proxy, TUN mode, exclusions, UDP/UoT/TLS transports, session roaming, network prober. |
| [`ostp-server/`](ostp-server) | Server: session dispatcher, relay to the internet, TCP sniffing (UoT, TLS, HTTP upgrade, decoy), certificates, subscriptions, web panel and API. |
| [`ostp-dns/`](ostp-dns) | Filtering DNS resolver for the server: block lists, rules, rewrites, cache. |
| [`ostp-tun/`](ostp-tun) | Platform TUN device and routing (Wintun on Windows). |
| [`ostp-tun-helper/`](ostp-tun-helper) | Privileged helper that runs the tunnel for the desktop GUI on Windows. |
| [`ostp-jni/`](ostp-jni) | JNI bindings used by the Android app. |
| [`ostp-gui/`](ostp-gui) | Desktop client (Tauri) for Windows and Linux; not part of the Cargo workspace. |
| [`ostp-flutter/`](ostp-flutter) | Android client (Flutter). |
| [`docs/`](docs) | Documentation in English and Russian, see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). |

## Branch Strategy

The repository runs three long-lived branches, in increasing order of stability:

| Branch | Role |
|---|---|
| `alpha` | Active development. All feature work and fixes land here first. |
| `beta` | Periodically fast-forwarded from `alpha` once it's had some soak time. Ships as the `{version}-beta` release channel. |
| `master` | Fast-forwarded from `beta` when it's proven stable. Real, tagged releases (`vX.Y.Z`) are cut from here. |

`beta` and `master` are **never** committed to directly - they only ever move forward by fast-forwarding from the branch below them. This means promotion is always a plain `git merge` with zero conflicts by construction: don't `git merge`/rebase feature work directly onto `beta` or `master`.

**Contributor PRs target `alpha`**, not `master`.

---

## Development Workflow

1.  **Check for existing issues** or open a new one to discuss proposed changes before starting work.
2.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `alpha`:
    ```bash
    git checkout alpha
    git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
    ```
3.  **Implement your changes**, ensuring you write appropriate unit or integration tests.
4.  **Format the files you changed** with `rustfmt`. The tree is not fully
    formatted yet, so do not run `cargo fmt --all` in a feature branch: it
    would bury your change in unrelated reformatting.
5.  **Run clippy** and do not add new warnings:
    ```bash
    cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
    ```
6.  **Ensure all tests pass**:
    ```bash
    cargo test --workspace
    ```
7.  **Add a line to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** (and [`CHANGELOG.ru.md`](CHANGELOG.ru.md)) under *Unreleased* for anything a user would notice.

## Commit Message Conventions

```
<type>(<scope>): <short, imperative summary>

<optional body - explain WHY, not what; the diff already shows what changed>
```

- **Type** - one of: `feat` (new capability), `fix` (bug fix), `docs`, `refactor` (no behavior change), `perf`, `test`, `chore` (deps/tooling/version bumps), `ci`, `security`.
- **Scope** (optional) - the crate or area touched: `client`, `server`, `core`, `gui`, `flutter`, `ci`, `docs`, etc. e.g. `fix(client): ...`.
- **Summary** - imperative mood ("add", not "added"/"adds"), no trailing period, ideally under ~70 characters.
- **Body** - only when the *why* isn't obvious from the diff: a prior bug this fixes, a constraint that shaped the approach, a tradeoff you made. Don't restate what the diff already shows. Wrap at ~72 columns.

```
fix(server): drop junk frames by per-key marker instead of a global one

A fixed 4-byte marker on every junk packet is itself a DPI signature any
observer can filter on across every OSTP deployment. Derive the marker
from the access key (HKDF, same scheme as obfuscation_key/psk) so it's
per-user and indistinguishable from the packet's own random payload.
```

Multiple unrelated changes belong in separate commits, not one bundled commit - it keeps `git bisect` and review useful. Squash-merge is fine for a PR with a few "fix typo" / "address review" commits, but don't squash logically distinct changes together.

## Coding Guidelines

*   **Safety**: Avoid using `unsafe` blocks unless absolutely necessary for low-level system bindings (e.g., FFI configurations like `setsockopt`). When using `unsafe`, add safety doc comments explaining why it is safe.
*   **Documentation**: Document public modules, structs, and functions. Maintain comment integrity across codebase changes.
*   **Logging**: Use the `tracing` framework for structured logging. Avoid `println!` for production logs.
*   **Aesthetics**: When editing GUI or Web components, adhere to premium, modern web design aesthetics (vibrant color palettes, glassmorphism, responsive grids).

## Submitting Pull Requests

1.  Push your branch to your GitHub fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin feat/your-feature-name
    ```
2.  Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting the `alpha` branch (see [Branch Strategy](#branch-strategy) - `master` only receives fast-forwards from `beta`, never direct PRs).
3.  In your PR description, explain the rationale behind your changes, what was fixed/added, and how it was tested.
4.  Verify that GitHub Actions CI runs successfully on your PR.
